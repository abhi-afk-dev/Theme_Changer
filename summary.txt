The theming system is implemented using CSS variables. 

**`frontend/src/index.css`:**
- Imports `tailwindcss`.
- Defines a set of CSS variables (e.g., `--primary-text-color`, `--background-color`, `--accent-color`) under the `:root` selector, which serves as the default (light) theme.
- Explicitly defines the same CSS variables under the `.theme-light` class, mirroring the default values.
- Defines a separate set of values for these CSS variables under the `.theme-dark` class to provide the dark theme.
- Also includes font-specific classes like `.robotocondensed-text` and `.bungee-text`.

**`frontend/src/App.css`:**
- Consumes the CSS variables defined in `index.css` to style various elements, such as `body`, `.app-container`, headings (`h1-h6`), paragraphs (`p`), links (`a`), buttons, and generic `.surface-element`.
- It uses `var(--variable-name)` to apply colors, backgrounds, and borders that automatically update when the theme changes.
- Includes `transition` properties for `background-color` and `color` to ensure smooth visual changes when the theme is toggled.

**Mechanism:**
- The `ThemeContext.jsx` (as observed from the context) is responsible for adding either `theme-light` or `theme-dark` class to the `document.documentElement` (the `<html>` tag). 
- This class then activates the corresponding set of CSS variables defined in `index.css`, which are propagated throughout the DOM and applied by the styles defined in `App.css` and other component-specific stylesheets.
